# project----language-Detector

Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document using machine learning. 
Language identification was a difficult task a few years ago because there was not a lot of data on languages, but nawadays data is available with ease, 
using data and with the help of Natural Language Processing(NLP) i build a models which can easily identify/detect the language of a text.

In this project, i used Naive Bayes algorithm, which had higher accuracy when compared with other algorithms.
The dataset used is from Kaggle ,which has 17 different languages text.
